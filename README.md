 Inferring dynamic responses in frequency, angle, and line flow of power grids using ambient synchrophasor data. More details please check our preprint “A Dynamic Response Recovery Framework Using Ambient Synchrophasor Data”: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05614
 
 Current test cases include 2nd order and 6th order model for the WSCC 9-bus system, and the synthetic Texas 2000-bus system:
 1. WSCC 9-bus system: test datasets were generated by PSAT on MATLAB (http://faraday1.ucd.ie/psat.html). System files and perturbation files are in ./sys_files/ . Please remember to set the system frequency as 60Hz, time domain simulation step size as 0.01s. For generating impulse responses 10-20s of time domain (TD) simulation is enough. For generating ambient data it is recommended to run TD for 3000s.
 2. The synthetic Texas 2000-bus system and the synthetic PMU data please refer to the paper 'Large-Scale Generation and Validation of Synthetic PMU Data' (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9019623) and 'Grid Structural Characteristics as Validation Criteria for Synthetic Networks' (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7725528)
